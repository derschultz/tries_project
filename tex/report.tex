\title{Nibbles and bytes: an implementation of the trie data structure using different branching factors}

\begin{abstract}
Rewrite this to frame this in terms of the code written, not the experiment done.\\
We explore the use of differing trie spread factors in the use of tries and the resulting performance differences across those different types of tries. Typically, tries are structured to store a string in a character by character fashion in a tree structure; our implementation compares the performance when the input bits are considered in 1-, 2-, 4-, or 8-bit chunks (a 1-bit trie may also be called a bitwise trie; an 8-bit trie is analogous to going character by character on a platform where a character variable consumes a single byte, as in many implementations of the C programming language).

\section{Introduction}
\label{Introduction}
Rewrite this to frame this in terms of the code written, not the experiment done.\\
In this report, we examine the use of tries that, instead of storing input strings in a character by character fashion, store input strings by taking a specific amount of bits at each node: 1, 2, 4, or 8. Typically, a trie will store a single character at each node; with an 8-bit character type as is usual in C, this results in 256 (2\textsuperscript{8}) children. However, if the amount of bits accounted for at each node is smaller, the amount of possible children on each node is also smaller, resulting in tries that are deeper in depth but fan out much less in terms of roots and leaves.

\noindent NAME

\noindent make\_trie, trie\_insert, trie\_delete, trie\_search - Create and interact with tries.\\

\noindent SYNOPSIS

\noindent Trie *make\_trie(enum trie\_type type);\\
int trie\_insert(Trie *t, void *item, int sz);\\
int trie\_delete(Trie *t, void *item, int sz);\\
int trie\_search(Trie *t, void *item, int sz);\\

\noindent DESCRIPTION

\noindent The make\_trie() function creates a trie struct in memory and returns a pointer to it. The type of trie (the branching factor) must be specified as one of the following enumerated values: BIT, DBLBIT, NIBBLE, BYTE.\\
The trie\_insert() function takes the data of length sz bytes which is pointed to by item and attempts inserts it into the trie t.\\
The trie\_delete() function takes the data of length sz bytes which is pointed to by item and attempts to remove it from the trie t.\\
The trie\_insert() function takes the data of length sz bytes which is pointed to by item and attempts inserts it into the trie t.\\
The trie\_delete() function takes the data of length sz bytes which is pointed to by item and attempts to remove it from the trie t.\\
The trie\_search() function takes the data of length sz bytes which is pointed to by item and attempts to find it in the trie t.\\

\noindent RETURN VALUE

\noindent The return value of make\_trie() is a pointer to a struct of type Trie which is suitable for use with the insert, delete, and search functions.\\
The trie\_insert function returns 1 when the specified value is inserted into the given trie and 0 on failure (due to the item already being present in the given trie).\\
The trie\_delete function returns 1 when the specified value is removed from the given trie and 0 on failure (due to the item not being found in the trie to delete).\\
The trie\_search function returns 1 when the specified value is found in the given trie and 0 otherwise.\\

\section{Conclusion and discussion}
what happened (nibble-based tries outperformed the others)\\
why (don't know. possibly due to caching strategy of cpu? perhaps dive into asm output of gcc)\\
further interest points (diff cpu types, more data input types like 128-bit integers)\\
